**Description**: My PCB is very simple. There is a button that turns the LED on and a button that turns the LED off. I used a capacitor to store the charge provided by the battery through the push button and used 2 NPN transistors to amplify the current (so the capacitor doesn't discharge quickly).

**Bill**:
1x red LED, 
4x 4.7k resistor, 
2x NPN transistor, 
1x capacitor, 
2x push button, 
2x battery cell,
